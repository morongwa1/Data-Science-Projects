Normalisation: a process of evaluating and correcting table structures in order to minimize
date redundancies and data anomalies. 

1NF: A table is in 1NF when all key attributes are defined, there are no repeating groups in the table,
and all attributes are dependent on the primary key.
 
2NF: A table is in 2NF when it is in 1NF and it includes no partial dependencies; meaning, no attribute
is dependent on only a portion of the primary key. 

3NF: A table is in 3NF when it is in 2NF and it contains no transitive dependencies.

Foreign key: columns that link to primary key columns in other tables, thereby 
creating a relationship
